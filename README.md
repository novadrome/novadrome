### 👋 Hey there, I'm Nova.

I work mainly in frontend web design with React + Typescript, and I'm hoping to venture into the world of backend as well to become full-stack 🙂

#### 📁 Projects
Check out some of my current projects!

* [eton](https://novadrome.github.io/eton) - time oriented note-taking *(React + TypeScript)*

* [hdri-hub-scraper](https://github.com/novadrome/hdri-hub-scraper) - Script that uses reverse engineering to download an hdri map from hdri-hub.com for free *(JavaScript)*

* [novadrome.github.io](https://novadrome.github.io) - Quick little GitHub Pages site, used for hosting projects to the public *(HTML + CSS)*

I've also created Discord Bots via Node + discord.js for servers such as Jonas Aden Family, Trap Nation, and Future House Music.
